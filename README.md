### Data Scientist

Hi! My name is Hernan. I am a mathematician and I have been teaching at the university for several years. I love programming, statistics and artificial intelligence. I am training in data science, since this discipline allows me to combine all these things, and I find it very interesting. I am looking for my first work experience in this area.

I have programming knowledge in R, Python (Pandas, Numpy, mathplotlib, etc.) and SQL. I also use Power Bi and Excel at an advanced level.

### Some projects I am or have been working on (in spanish for the moment):

https://github.com/HGalletti/Album-de-figuritas (Simulation with R)

https://github.com/HGalletti/Reservas_hoteleras (Data analytics and visualization with Power Bi)
