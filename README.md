### Data Scientist
Hi! I am a mathematician oriented to programming, statistics and artificial intelligence. I am training in data science, since this discipline allows me to combine all these things and solve real problems with tools that I learned in my training. I am especially interested in the insurance sector and the financial sector, as I have knowledge in investments, risks and some metrics and models used in financial risk and portfolios analysis .
I am looking for my first work experience solving business problems with these tools.

I know intermediate programming in R, Python (Pandas, Numpy, Mathplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, etc.), and experience querying SQL databases. I also handle Power Bi and Excel at an advanced level.

### Some projects I am or I have been working on (in spanish for the moment):

https://github.com/HGalletti/Album-de-figuritas (A little simulation with R)

https://github.com/HGalletti/Reservas_hoteleras (Data analytics and visualization with Power Bi)

https://github.com/HGalletti/Prestamos-bancarios (Data Science Project with Python, Pandas, Sklearn, etc).
