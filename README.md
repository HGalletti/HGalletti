### Data Scientist

I’m a data scientist with a solid foundation in mathematics, statistics, and computing. I hold a degree in mathematics and completed part of a PhD program in data science.

Thanks to my experience in research and teaching, I’ve developed strong communication skills, particularly when it comes to explaining complex concepts to non-technical audiences. Combined with a rigorous analytical approach, this allows me to find effective, practical solutions to data-driven problems.

I have experience in:

- **Languages & Tools:** Python, R, SQL (SQL Server, BigQuery, Db2), Power BI
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Darts, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.
