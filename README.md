### Data Scientist
Hello! I'm Hern√°n, a data scientist with solid foundations in mathematics, statistics and computing. I graduated in M. Sc. in mathematics and did a few years of a PhD focused on data science.
Thanks to teaching and research, I have experience in communicating complex concepts to a non-technical audience, and solving problems analytically, two qualities that I consider essential in the role of a data scientist.
I program in R, Python (Pandas, Numpy, Mathplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, etc.), at an intermediate level. I also have experience in Power Bi, SQL and Excel database queries.

### Some projects I am or I have been working on (in spanish for the moment):

https://github.com/HGalletti/Album-de-figuritas (A little simulation with R)

https://github.com/HGalletti/Reservas_hoteleras (Data analytics and visualization with Power Bi)

https://github.com/HGalletti/Prestamos-bancarios (Data Science Project with Python, Pandas, Sklearn, etc).
