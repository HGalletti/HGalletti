### Data Scientist

I'm Hernán, a Data Scientist with a solid background in mathematics, statistics, and computing. I hold a degree in mathematics and I'm currently pursuing a master's in Data Science.

I have experience in ETL processes, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and developing predictive models. I'm proficient in Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, TensorFlow), R, SQL, and Power BI. My previous experience in teaching and research has also allowed me to effectively communicate complex ideas to diverse audiences.

I'm excited about applying my skills to tackle challenging problems in data science and machine learning. If you have a project or idea in mind, feel free to contact me at HernanGalletti@gmail.com or send me a direct message here. I'm always open to discussing new and interesting opportunities!

I have experience in:

- **Languages & Tools:** Python, R, SQL (SQL Server, BigQuery, Db2), Power BI
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Darts, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.

**Forecasting Interest Rate Spreads:** https://github.com/HGalletti/Forecasting-Spread-Treasury-Bonds.git - A time series analysis project focused on predicting the 2Y-10Y interest rate spread. It leverages classic statistical models (ARIMA/SARIMA/SARIMAX) and integrates key market indicators like the VIX and S&P 500 as exogenous variables to enhance forecast accuracy and demonstrate advanced financial time series modeling.

**CV Assistant Chatbot:** https://huggingface.co/spaces/HernanGalletti/CV_Hernan_Galletti - An AI-powered chatbot that answers questions about my experience, education, and skills using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces with Gradio and LangChain. Supports both English and Spanish, and logs user interactions anonymously for analysis.

**Smart Electoral Assistant:** https://github.com/HGalletti/Asistente_electoral - ElectoAI is an AI-powered app using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer legal and operational questions about the 2025 Buenos Aires (CABA) elections.

### Some older personal projects (2022–2023)

Based on public datasets (mainly from Kaggle). I'm currently working on adding recent real-world projects.
