### Data Scientist
Hello! I am Hern√°n, a data scientist with solid foundations in mathematics, statistics and computing. I graduated with a degree in mathematics and completed part of a PhD program in data science.


Thanks to my experience in teaching and research, I've developed the ability to communicate complex concepts in an accessible manner for non-technical audiences. Additionally, my analytical approach allows me to tackle problems with effective solutions, two crucial skills in the field of data science.


I have experience in programming in R and Python, including libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. I also have experience with Power BI, SQL (SQL Server, Google Big Query, IBM Db2, among others), and Excel.

### Some projects I am or I have been working on:
